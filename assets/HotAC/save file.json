Right click the model you intend to move\r\n2. Under ship name, there will be an empty text box (dim \"Description\" label visible), enter your command there\r\r\n3. Click anywhere on the map (closing the context menu)\n\r\nBoom! Your ship will automatically move.\r\n\nIf your ship model is not standard (didn't came from the Collection  or Squad Builder), to make it move like a large base ship you have to add 'LGS' anywhere in its name.\n\r\nMove List (# = speed of the move: 1-5)\nexamples\r\n3 bank left = bl3 (or be3)\r\n2 turn right = tr2\n\r\ns# = straight # \r\nk# = koiogran turn #\r\nbr# = bank right #\r\ntr# = turn right #\r\nbl# = bank left #\r\ntl# = turn left #\r\n\r\nAlternative left moves:\r\nbe# = bank left #\r\nte# = turn left #\r\n\r\nbl#s = Segnor's loop left #\nbr#s = Segnor's loop right #\n\ntl#t = Talon roll left #\ntr#t = Talon roll right #\n\ntl#z = Slip turn left #\ntr#z = Slip turn right #\n\nbl#z = Slip bank left #\nbr#z = Slip bank right #\n\nbl#r  = Reverse bank left #\nbr#r = Reverse bank right #\ns#r = Reverse #\n\nrl2 = Barrel Roll left\nrr2 = Barrel Roll right\nrl1 = Barrel Roll left forward\nrr1 = Barrel Roll right forward\nrl3 = Barrel Roll left back\nrr3 = Barrel Roll right back\n\ncs = decloak straight\ncl1 = decloak left forward\ncl2 = decloak left\ncl3 = decloak left back\ncr1 = decloak right forward\ncr2 = decloak right\ncr3 = decloak right back\n\nEcho decloaking available with the decloack token (drop the token on the ship and the appropriate buttons will appear\n\nr = range/arc ruler \n\nr (on a bomb token) = range 1 template\n\nq/undo = Undo the ship position to last saved one. Positions are automatically saved before/after a move and can be saved manually (refer to 'keep')\r\n\nz/redo = Redo ship position if you undid ('q/undo') accidentally\n\nkeep = Save a ship's location.  After using the keep command you can pick up and move the ship around then use 'q' to return the ship to the saved location.\n\nFor more advanced commands, check:\nhttps://github.com/tjakubo2/TTS_xwing/wiki/Doc%3A-Commands\n\nNote: Ships automatically lock after auto movement.  You can right click on the ship to manually enter moves (ie barrel roll after movement).  You can also unlock the ship to move it for any reason.\n\nAUTO DIALS GUIDE:\nPlace your ship models in your hiden zone and click \"Assign Dials\". If you have more than 6, right click the adjacent zone with zone tool (F4) and change it to your color, then use the button next to it.\r\n",

This involves checking the action's\r\npre-conditions (if the ship is in the right situation to attempt it), then if\r\nthe ship can actually execute the action, and finally checking the action's\r\npost-conditions (if the action met with the desired result).\r\n\r\nWhere this gets complicated is the use of action probes, which are hypothetical\r\nfuture positions of the ship. So if a ship makes a boost, then we create a probe\r\nfor each type of boost (bl1, s1, br1) and evaluate the post-conditions for each\r\nprobe. Where this gets _really_ complicated is when handling ships that can\r\nstring together more than one move action, such as the Interceptor's boost\r\naction linking to a barrel roll action. For this we have to \"expand\" the first\r\nset of probes by the second action - so the probe \"bl1\" expands into six more\r\nprobes: \"bl1 > rl1\", \"bl1 > rl2\", \"bl1 > rl3\", \"bl1 > rr1\", \"bl1 > rr2\", and\r\n\"bl1 > rr3\". These permutations can get quite large (45 in the case of the\r\nInterceptor) so these are cached where possible, but even so they can lead to\r\nlong execution times.\r\n\r\nFinally, the actions are packed into a stack and processed one-by-one.
