-- The following are the available Player.Action.* constants. They are `int`s
-- Copy - Copy (or commence cloning) the targets.
-- Cut - Cut (copy and delete) the targets.
-- Delete - Delete the targets.
-- FlipIncrementalLeft - Incrementally rotate the targets counter-clockwise around their flip axes, typically the scene's Z-axis.
-- FlipIncrementalRight - Incrementally rotate the targets clockwise around their flip axes, typically the scene's Z-axis.
-- FlipOver - Rotate the targets 179 degrees around their flip axes, typically the scene's Z-axis i.e. toggle the targets between face up and face down.
-- Group - Group the targets.
-- Paste - Paste (spawn) the targets.
-- PickUp - Pick up the targets.
-- Randomize - Randomize the targets.
-- RotateIncrementalLeft - Rotate the targets incrementally, typically counter-clockwise around the scene's Y-axis. Instead of being rotated exclusively around the Y-axis, dice will be rotated to the previous rotation value.
-- RotateIncrementalRight - Rotate the targets incrementally, typically clockwise around the scene's Y-axis. Instead of being rotated exclusively around the Y-axis, dice will be rotated to the next rotation value.
-- RotateOver - Rotate the targets 179 degrees around the scene's Y-axis.
-- Select - Add the targets to the player's selection.
-- Under - Move the targets underneath objects below them on table.
